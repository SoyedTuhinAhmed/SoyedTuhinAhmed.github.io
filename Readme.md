[**Best Paper Candidate**. <details> <summary>Abstract:</summary>In the age of automation, machine learning systems for real-time critical decisions in various domains such as autonomous driving are at an all-time high. Predictive uncertainty allows a machine learning system to make more insightful decisions by avoiding blind predictions. Algorithmically, Bayesian neural networks (BayNNs) based on dropout are principled methods for estimating predictive uncertainty in a machine learning application. However, the computational cost and power consumption make the use of BayNNs on embedded hardware unattractive. Hardware accelerators with emerging non-volatile resistive memories (NVMs) such as Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) in conjunction with quantized models are an interesting option for efficient implementations of such a system. Binary BayNNs are a desirable alternative  that can provide predictive uncertainty efficiently by combining the benefits of quantization and hardware acceleration. In this paper, propose for the first time the binary bayesian neural network (BayBNN) using dropout-based approximation, and we leverage the inherent randomness of spintronic devices for in-memory Bayesian inference. Our proposed method can
