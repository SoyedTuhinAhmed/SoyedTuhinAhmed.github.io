# Research Statement

The primary focus of my research lies at the intersection of neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and fault tolerance in the context of emerging hardware technologies. My work aims to develop efficient and robust neuromorphic systems based on spintronic devices and resistive memories while addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation, fault-tolerance, and variability.

One of the main goals of my research is to explore efficient uncertainty estimation techniques for neuromorphic computing. In this regard, I have proposed Binary Bayesian Neural Networks (BBNNs) leveraging the inherent stochasticity of spintronic devices [C1, C4]. This approach has led to the development of a scalable spintronics-based Bayesian Neural Network [C4] and the SpinDrop technique for dropout-based Bayesian Binary Neural Networks [J2].

Another significant aspect of my work revolves around addressing the reliability and fault-tolerance issues in neuromorphic fabrics based on resistive memories. My research has resulted in novel techniques like NeuroScrub and NeuroScrub+ for mitigating retention failures using approximate scrubbing [C2, J1]. Additionally, I have explored online fault-tolerance using local approximation for memristive neuromorphic fabric [C3] and compact functional test generation for memristive deep learning implementations using approximate gradient ranking [C5].

To further enhance the fault tolerance in neuromorphic computing, I have investigated functional ATPG-based methods for post-manufacturing re-calibration [C7, J3]. These techniques enable fault-tolerant neuromorphic systems while minimizing the overhead associated with conventional approaches.

Variability is another critical challenge in emerging hardware technologies that I have addressed in my research. I have proposed techniques for ensuring process and runtime variation robustness for spintronic-based neuromorphic fabric [C6]. Moreover, I have investigated design-time reference current generation for robust spintronic-based neuromorphic architectures [J4].

Lastly, to maximize the potential of spintronic-based architectures, I have explored algorithm-hardware co-design techniques for uncertainty estimation [J5]. This work underlines the importance of collaborative design to optimize and adapt algorithms for efficient implementation on specialized hardware.

In summary, my research aims to address the challenges in neuromorphic computing using emerging hardware technologies like spintronics and resistive memories. Through novel techniques for efficient uncertainty estimation, fault tolerance, and robustness, I endeavor to pave the way for practical, energy-efficient, and reliable neuromorphic systems.
